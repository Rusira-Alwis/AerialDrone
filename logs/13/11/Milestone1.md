flight video 1:

- pre flight tests
- motor function
- observing flight viability, will it actually be able to fly safely?

flight video 2:

- increasing throttle
- visual callibration and motor order cofnirmation, does forward go forward?
- throttle control

- note: drone flipping is likely due to legs being caught in grass, try take off on concrete next time
- note: my first time flying a drone...

successful flight video 1:

-   successful take off, flight, and landing
- confirms successful wiring, callibrations, build, weight distrubution, throttle power
- multiple crashes prior to this video, reassures build quality and robustness

```to do```
- document/video GPS autonomy (already confirmed functionality)
- create post flight processing system
